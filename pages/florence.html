Working on Project Florence this year with the ARES Rocketry Team has been a whirlwind of learning, innovation, and camaraderie. As a member of the flight simulations subteam, I had the opportunity to dive into various problems, working closely with an amazing group of people. Our primary goal was to ensure the rocket's trajectory was optimized and precise, a task that required extensive use of tools like OpenRocket, RasAero, and RocketPy. Each tool offered different levels of effectiveness and complexity, with RocketPy ultimately proving to be the most powerful for our needs.

<br></br>

OpenRocket served as our introduction to trajectory simulations. It's user-friendly and great for getting a general idea of how a rocket might behave. However, as we delved deeper into the nuances of our rocket's flight, we transitioned to RasAero, which provided more detailed aerodynamic analysis. Finally, we landed on RocketPy, a Python-based library that allowed for intricate and highly customizable simulations. With RocketPy, we could factor in real-world variables and stochastic elements, making our simulations incredibly robust.

<br></br>

One of my key responsibilities was working on the embedded control system for the rocket's active control airbrake system. This system was crucial for adjusting the rocket's descent and ensuring we hit our target altitude. We collaborated extensively, integrating data from various subteams to write the embedded systems. This collaboration was vital, as it allowed us to create efficient and time-saving technologies that improved our overall process. The development of these systems required a deep understanding of both hardware and software, as we needed to ensure that our code could effectively control the physical components of the airbrakes in real-time.

<br></br>

Testing the logic behind the airbrakes was a significant part of my role. We used simulation data to predict how the airbrakes would behave under different conditions and then compared these predictions with real flight data. Employing a variety of statistical methods, including regression analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we refined our models and improved the accuracy of our predictions. This iterative process of testing and validation was both challenging and rewarding, as it pushed us to continually improve our designs. We had to account for numerous variables, such as wind speed, air pressure, and temperature, all of which could impact the rocket's trajectory and the effectiveness of the airbrakes.

<br></br>

Beyond the technical aspects, being part of the ARES team was an incredible experience on a personal level. I made many friends and forged connections that will last a lifetime. We had the chance to attend multiple launches, each one an opportunity to see our hard work in action and to learn from the outcomes. One of the highlights was Launch Night, a sponsor event where we showcased the technologies we developed. It was a proud moment to review our achievements and demonstrate the innovative solutions we created. The camaraderie and shared sense of purpose among team members made every challenge more manageable and every success more meaningful.

<br></br>

Our ultimate goal was the Spaceport America Cup, the pinnacle of our efforts. Competing against 151 teams, we managed to secure 2nd place in our category and 4th overall. The main objective of the competition was to reach as close to 30,000 feet as possible without exceeding it. We came within less than 1% of this target, a testament to the precision and effectiveness of our simulations and control systems. Although we didn't take the top spot, being the closest to the target altitude felt like a huge success. Our performance was a validation of the countless hours we spent refining our simulations, testing our hardware, and optimizing our control algorithms.

<br></br>

The competition itself was an incredible experience. We had the opportunity to interact with teams from all over the world, each bringing their own unique approaches and innovations to rocketry. The sense of community and mutual respect among competitors was palpable, and we learned a great deal from observing and discussing other teams' designs and strategies. This exchange of ideas and knowledge was one of the most enriching aspects of the competition, as it broadened our perspectives and inspired us to push the boundaries of what we thought was possible.

<br></br>

Reflecting on this journey, I realize how much I've grown both technically and personally. The skills I developed, from using advanced simulation tools to writing and testing embedded systems, are invaluable. More importantly, the friendships and experiences I've gained are irreplaceable. Project Florence was more than just a technical challenge; it was a collaborative adventure that taught me the power of teamwork and innovation. As I look forward to future projects, I carry with me the lessons learned and the memories made with the ARES Rocketry Team.

<br></br>

One of the most significant lessons I learned was the importance of communication and collaboration. Working with a diverse team of individuals, each with their own areas of expertise, required us to constantly share information, provide feedback, and support one another. This collaborative environment fostered creativity and innovation, as we were able to combine our different perspectives and skills to solve complex problems. It also taught me the value of perseverance and adaptability, as we often encountered unexpected challenges that required us to rethink our approaches and find new solutions.

<br></br>

Another memorable aspect of my experience was the hands-on nature of our work. From assembling the rocket to testing the airbrakes and analyzing flight data, every step of the process was an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting. This hands-on experience was incredibly rewarding, as it allowed me to see the tangible results of our efforts and provided a deeper understanding of the principles and concepts we were working with. It also reinforced the importance of attention to detail and thoroughness, as even small errors or oversights could have significant impacts on the rocket's performance.

<br></br>

In conclusion, working on Project Florence with the ARES Rocketry Team was an unforgettable experience that combined technical challenge, personal growth, and the thrill of competition. The skills and knowledge I gained, the friendships I made, and the memories I created will stay with me for a lifetime. As I continue my studies and pursue new projects, I am grateful for the lessons learned and the incredible journey I had with ARES. This experience has not only made me a better engineer but also a more resilient and adaptable individual, ready to take on whatever challenges lie ahead.
